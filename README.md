# Aahil Rupsi - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and showcases my placeholder skills and projects as a web developer.

## Project Enhancements

For this version of the website, I focused on modernizing the codebase and improving the overall user experience. The key changes include a major refactor of the portfolio page, converting the layout from a static table to a responsive CSS Grid. This improves the visual appeal and makes the site more accessible on various devices. To enhance interactivity, I implemented a project filtering feature using JavaScript, allowing users to easily sort projects by technology. Finally, all inline JavaScript was externalized into a single file for better code organization and maintainability. These changes were made to align the site with current web development best practices, emphasizing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly design.
